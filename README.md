# Project Title: React-Flask Web Application

**Description:**

Welcome to my React-Flask Web Application project! This repository houses an innovative web application that synergizes the robust capabilities of React for the front-end with the versatile Flask framework for the back-end. As a recent Master's graduate in Computer Science, I embarked on this project to hone my skills in full-stack development and explore the integration of these two powerful technologies.

**Key Features:**

1. React Front-End:

- Interactive UI/UX design.
- State management using React Hooks.
- Responsive layout ensuring compatibility across various devices and screen sizes.
2. Flask Back-End:
- RESTful API development.
- Secure handling of requests and data.
- Integration with a database for data persistence.
Integration:
- Seamless integration of React with Flask.
- Efficient state management between the client and server-side.
- Implementation of authentication and authorization for user security.

**Learning Objectives:**

- To develop a comprehensive understanding of full-stack web development.
- To practice and apply concepts learned during my Master's program in a practical, project-based environment.
- To explore advanced features of React and Flask, such as hooks in React and Flask's SQLAlchemy integration.

**Technologies Used:**

- Front-End: React.js, HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6+)
- Back-End: Flask, Python, MondoDB
- Tools: Git for version control, VS Code, Docker
